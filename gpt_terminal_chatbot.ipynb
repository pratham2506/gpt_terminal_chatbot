            "You : tell me about python\n",
            "Chatbot :  Python is a high-level programming language that was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It is designed to emphasize code readability and simplicity, making it a popular choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike. \n",
            "\n",
            "Here are some key features of Python:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Readability: Python's syntax is easy to read and understand, which makes it more maintainable and less error-prone.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Simplicity: Python's minimalist syntax makes it quick to learn, write, and debug code.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Versatility: Python can be used for a wide range of purposes, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scripting, and more.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Large Standard Library: Python comes with an extensive standard library that provides numerous modules and functions to simplify common programming tasks.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Interpreted: Python code is executed line by line using an interpreter, which makes it easier to test and debug code.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. Object-Oriented: Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP), allowing you to create and use classes and objects to organize code and data.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. Cross-Platform: Python is compatible with major operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it easy to write code that runs on different platforms.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. Community and Ecosystem: Python has a vibrant and active community of developers who contribute to open-source projects, libraries, and frameworks, making it easy to find resources and support.\n",
            "\n",
            "Python uses an indentation-based syntax, where the indentation level determines the grouping of statements. This encourages clean and readable code, but it also requires attention to proper indentation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Python has a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks, such as Django, Flask, NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. These libraries extend Python's capabilities for specific purposes, such as web development, scientific computing, machine learning, and more.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, Python's simplicity, readability, and versatility have contributed to its popularity and wide adoption in various industries and domains.\n",

            "2. Pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis, offering data structures and functions for efficiently handling structured data like tables and time series.\n",
            "3. Matplotlib: A plotting library that provides a wide variety of plots, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, and more.\n",
            "4. SciPy: A library that builds on NumPy, providing additional functionality for scientific computing, including modules for statistics, optimization, integration, interpolation, and more.\n",
            "5. PyTorch: A popular deep learning library that provides tools for working with neural networks, including automatic differentiation, model optimization, and GPU acceleration.\n",
            "6. TensorFlow: An open-source library for machine learning, widely used for building and training deep learning models, particularly neural networks.\n",
            "7. Scikit-learn: A library that provides a wide range of machine learning algorithms and tools, including tools for data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.\n",
            "8. Django: A high-level web framework for building web applications in Python. It provides a convenient way to handle database interactions, URL routing, template rendering, and more.\n",
            "9. Flask: Another web framework for Python, but with a more lightweight and minimalistic approach compared to Django. It is often used for building small to medium-sized web applications.\n",
            "10. Requests: A library for making HTTP requests and working with web APIs, offering a simple interface for sending HTTP requests and handling responses.\n",
